# svg4j

Svg4j is an optimizing and stacking tool for [Scalable Vector Graphics][svg],
written in [Java][java].

With SVGs being [heavily supported][caniuse-svg] on the web many may wish to
compress and package all of their SVG assets into a single optimized file. This
technique is known as using a [sprite-sheet][spritesheet]. This can be achieved
in SVG documents with the use of [SVG fragment identifiers][svg-fragments], a
method of rendering part of an SVG by defining a view ID and referring to it in
an `<img>` tag. This technique is [fairly supported][caniuse-svg-fragment] by
most modern browsers.

## Usage

An example of the tool's usage is provided in the
[`Svg4j`](api/src/main/java/com/mikebull94/svg4j/Svg4j.java) class. The example
searches in [`api/src/main/resources`](api/src/main/resources) for files with
the `.svg` extension, stacking and optimizing them into
`api/build/resources/main`. This directory also contains an
[`example.html`](api/src/main/resources/example.html) file that shows how to
refer to the embedded SVG elements by their fragment identifier.

The example SVGs included in the distribution are variations of the [Wikimedia
Community Logo][wikimedia-community-logo], licensed for any purpose within the
public domain.

```java
Svg4j svg4j = new Svg4j();
SvgViewBox viewBox = new SvgViewBox(0, 0, 500, 500);
Path svg1 = Paths.get("input_dir", "svg1.svg");
Path svg2 = Paths.get("input_dir", "svg2.svg");
XmlDocument stacked = svg4j.stack(viewBox, svg1, svg2);
Path output = result.write(Paths.get("output.svg"));
```

## Building

[Gradle][gradle] is used as the project's build system. The [Gradle Wrapper]
[gradle-wrapper] is included in the distribution, therefore you do not need to
install Gradle on your system.

To build the program and generate the Javadoc, run:

* `./gradlew` (on Unix-like platforms such as Linux and Mac OS X)
* `gradlew` (on Windows using the [gradlew.bat](gradlew.bat) batch file)

[FindBugs™][findbugs] and [PMD][pmd] are used to [lint][lint] the Java code and
will fail the build on rule violations.

## Testing

[Unit tests](api/src/test/java) are written in a [behaviour-driven-development]
[bdd]
style and run using [JUnit][junit] and [Mockito][mockito].

Code coverage reports are generated by [JaCoCo][jacoco].

## Dependencies

* [Java][java] 8 or above
* [Google Guava][guava]
* [SLF4J][slf4j] for logging
* [JUnit][junit] for unit tests
* [Mockito][mockito] for unit tests
* [APIviz][apiviz] for UML-like class diagrams in the generated Javadoc
* [JaCoCo][jacoco] for code test coverage reports
* [FindBugs™][findbugs] for Java code linting
* [PMD][pmd] for Java code linting
